Troubleshooting
===============

1. There is `bug in PyTube <https://github.com/pytube/pytube/issues/1281>`_
that shows message:

`Pytube Error: get_throttling_function_name: could not find match for multiple`

The solution is in the discussion.

2. PyTube cannot convert subtitles from xml format to srt format. This problem
is bypassed in the code of this script.

If you find any bugs while using script or come up with an idea for
improvement, feel free to `report <https://github.com/tagezi/ytvd/issues>`_
them.
